# DM510 assignment 3

The task for assignment 3 is to implement a basic file system using
[FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)
with a single file as the backing store.

Note that the code for my particular implementation is particularly shitty
(hence the name **T**errible **F**ile **S**ystem),
so copying it will most definitely net you no gain.
May it serve as a starting point to your endeavors.
